# Aave Integration Changes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate the newly deployed rent escrow contract with Aave. The contract has been updated to detect Aave deposits and verify them, changing the escrow state to reflect successful deposits.

## Contract Address Update

The new contract has been deployed at:
```
0x4b8ac7a06a42d43fc3c3858a001dede0c91b8a3ea78297eea2bb26b26bc3cf3a
```

This address has been updated in the following files:
- `constants.ts` - Both `RENT_ESCROW_ADDRESS` and `MODULE_ADDRESS` constants
- `aaveIntegration.ts` - Updated all function calls to use the correct module name

## Key Changes

1. **Contract Address Update**:
   - Updated all references to the contract address in constants.ts
   - Ensured all utility files reference the updated address

2. **Aave Integration Utilities**:
   - Updated the aaveIntegration.ts file to use the correct contract address and module name
   - Modified function calls to use the proper module name from constants

3. **Frontend Components**:
   - The EscrowDashboard.tsx component was already updated to use the verifyAaveDeposit function
   - handleDepositToAave function correctly calls the Aave deposit and verification functions

## Contract Functions

The new contract implements the following key functions for Aave integration:

1. **verify_aave_deposit**: Verifies that a tenant has deposited to Aave and updates escrow state
2. **get_escrow_deposit_status**: View function to check if an escrow has been successfully funded

## Next Steps

1. Test the integration by creating a new escrow agreement
2. Sign the agreement as both landlord and tenant
3. Deposit funds directly to Aave
4. Verify the deposit is correctly detected and the escrow state is updated

## Notes

- The EscrowDashboardWithAave.tsx component has some type errors that may need to be addressed if that component is used
- The main EscrowDashboard.tsx component is properly updated to work with the new contract
